Time Management in Java
This Java project showcases a simple implementation of a time management system using the Time class. The Time class allows for the representation and manipulation of date and time components, including years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds.

Features
Time Class:

The Time class encapsulates the properties related to date and time, such as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second. It provides methods to set and get these properties and display time in various formats.
Constructors:

The class includes constructors to initialize instances of Time with default values or specific date and time components.
Input and Display:

The class includes methods to input date and time interactively using a Scanner and display the date and time in both universal and standard formats.
Time Addition:

The add method allows for adding a specified Time instance to another instance, updating the properties accordingly.
Usage
The TestTime class demonstrates how to use the Time class by creating instances, setting values, and performing operations such as displaying the time and adding time.
